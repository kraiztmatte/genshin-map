# Genshin Impact Interactive world map

this map was forked from chinese genshin impact map, currently working on translate stuff.

## How to use:

1. Click the button on the right to call up the filter

2. Each item has a [serial number id], which is convenient for checking deficiencies, and you can click the mark to view the remarks

3. Each item can be [marked], which is convenient for travelers to mark the items that have been acquired

4. There is a corresponding [picture] for the treasure chest. Mom no longer has to worry about finding the treasure chest. (Some treasure chests in Mond have no pictures. It may be because there is no screenshot or the position is inaccurate. Please refer to the public beta)

5. Currently optimized for PC, there may be some unexpected new (B) features (U) features (G) on the mobile phone.

6. If travelers find a problem, you can [[click here and briefly describe the problem]](https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DSm9jV29kcFVHdVZL?tab=BB08J2)
